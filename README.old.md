## Description
This website allows users to brows through my growing portfolio of coding projects. The project portfolio is a third attempt at my original portfolio website, with a new layout, code updates, bug fixes and additional material.

In order to scroll to work, just click on the item you are looking for and you can view the github repo or the deployed page, if it exists. 

You can also add an email and contact info for more information

Feel free to brows my github, linkin, read about me, etc. 

## Known Bugs and Future Improvements
More work will be done in the future to choose a more comprehensive theme and layout, and to add to the inventory on the page.
